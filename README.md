# About me
I am a newbie programmer and having the most knowledge in Python but not fully :P
I play games on some weekdays when my friends come but I mostly play on Sundays
I play games like War Thunder (2nd favourite), Minecraft (My favourite), Shadow Fight 2 (3rd favourite) and WoTB sometimes
I have a YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA-6XPBGO-JIa3IUuCWwZ1Q
